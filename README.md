# Project Overview

## Analyzing-Stock-and-Revenue-Data
IBM Python Project for Data Science

For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. 

My job was to extract stock data using the "yfinance python library API" and revenue data from webpages for _Tesla and GameStop_, and built a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla and GameStop.
