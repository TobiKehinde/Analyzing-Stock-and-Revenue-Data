# Project Overview

## Analyzing-Stock-and-Revenue-Data
IBM Python Project for Data Science

For this project, I extracted stock data using the "yfinance python library API" and revenue data from webpages for _Tesla and GameStop_, and built a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. The project aims to help customers invest their money in stocks.
